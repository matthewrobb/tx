# twisted-workflow

A configurable orchestration layer for agentic development with Claude Code.

Decompose objectives into parallel issues, execute them across isolated worktrees, and delegate review/QA/shipping to your preferred tools — with session-independent state and preset-based configuration.

## How It Works

Claude Code sessions end. Context resets. Work disappears.

twisted-workflow stores every objective in a `.twisted/` directory organized as a kanban board: `todo/`, `in-progress/`, `done/`. Each objective carries its own state, research, requirements, issues, and plan. Start a session, run `/twisted-work`, and pick up exactly where you left off.

The execute step takes this further: one git worktree per agent, parallel execution across groups, configurable merge strategies. Delegatable phases route to external tools (gstack, Superpowers, Nimbalyst) or use built-in implementations.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add matthewrobb/twisted-workflow

# Install the plugin
/plugin install twisted-workflow@twisted-workflow

# Set up your project (detects tools, suggests preset)
/twisted-work init

# Start your first objective
/twisted-work
```

## The Pipeline

```
research ──> scope ──> arch_review ──> decompose ──> execute ──> code_review ──> qa ──> ship
```

Core steps (scope, decompose, execute) are always owned by twisted-workflow. Delegatable steps (research, arch_review, code_review, qa, ship) route to configured providers or skip entirely.

| Step | What happens | Default model | Mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| **research** | Parallel subagents explore the codebase | (delegatable) | execute |
| **scope** | Drill requirements one category at a time until concrete | opus | execute |
| **arch_review** | Architecture review before decomposition | (delegatable, skip by default) | — |
| **decompose** | Break into issues, estimate complexity, assign agents, plan groups | opus | plan |
| **execute** | Objective branch from main, parallel agent worktrees, group-by-group merge | sonnet 1M | execute |
| **code_review** | Full review of all changes on the objective branch | (delegatable) | — |
| **qa** | QA verification | (delegatable, skip by default) | — |
| **ship** | Merge to main, changelog, lane move to done | (delegatable) | — |

Auto-advances by default. Pauses when model/effort settings change between steps, context is running low, or `flow.auto_advance` is set to `false` (always pause).

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/twisted-work` | Scan objectives, resume or start new |
| `/twisted-work init` | Create `.twisted/`, detect tools, select preset |
| `/twisted-work status` | Show all objectives across all lanes |
| `/twisted-work status {name}` | Detailed status for a single objective |
| `/twisted-work next` | Advance the most recently active objective |
| `/twisted-work next {name}` | Advance a named objective to its next step |
| `/twisted-work resume {name}` | Resume a named objective at its current step |
| `/twisted-work scope` | Explicitly trigger the scope step |
| `/twisted-work decompose` | Explicitly trigger decomposition |
| `/twisted-work execute` | Explicitly trigger parallel execution |
| `/twisted-work review` | Explicitly trigger code review delegation |
| `/twisted-work ship` | Explicitly trigger ship delegation |
| `/twisted-work config` | Show full config overview |
| `/twisted-work config {section}` | Drill into a config section |

Add `--yolo` to any command to skip confirmations and auto-advance:

```bash
/twisted-work next --yolo
```

## Directory Structure

```
.twisted/
├── settings.json                        # sparse overrides only
├── todo/
│   └── {objective}/
│       ├── state.md                     # frontmatter = source of truth
│       ├── RESEARCH-*.md
│       ├── REQUIREMENTS.md

├── in-progress/

├── done/

└── worktrees/                           # gitignored
    ├── {objective}/                     # objective branch (from main)
    └── {objective}-agent-N/             # agent branch (from objective)
```

Frontmatter in `state.md` is the source of truth. Folders mirror frontmatter by default (configurable). Files never rename — the parent folder moves between lanes. Worktrees are temporary.

## Configuration

Run `/twisted-work init` to detect tools and select a preset. Run `/twisted-work config` to view and modify any setting.

Three-layer sparse override system:

```
deepMerge(defaults, presets[name] ?? {}, projectSettings ?? {})
```

`settings.json` stores only your overrides. Plugin updates apply new defaults automatically.

```json
{
  "preset": "gstack+superpowers",
  "execution": { "strategy": "task-tool", "worktree_tiers": 2 },
  "files": { "changelog": "docs/CHANGELOG.md" }
}
```

## Provider Delegation

Delegatable phases route to external tools:

| Format | Example |
|---|---|
| `"built-in"` | twisted-workflow's own implementation |
| `"gstack:/{command}"` | `"gstack:/office-hours"`, `"gstack:/review"` |
| `"superpowers:{skill}"` | `"superpowers:requesting-code-review"` |
| `"nimbalyst:{skill}"` | `"nimbalyst:deep-researcher"` |
| `"skip"` | Omit this phase |
| `"ask"` | Ask user each time |

## Works With

twisted-workflow integrates with these tools through provider delegation and presets:

| Tool | Integration |
|---|---|
| [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) | Build discipline (TDD), code review |
| [gstack](https://github.com/gstack) | Research, architecture review, code review, QA, shipping |
| [Nimbalyst](https://nimbalyst.com) | Deep research, branch review |

All integrations are optional. twisted-workflow works standalone.

## Complexity-Driven Agent Assignment

During decomposition, each issue gets a complexity estimate. Thresholds drive agent assignment:

| Complexity | Strategy | Example |
|---|---|---|
| ≤ batch threshold (2) | Batch into one agent | Three config changes → one agent |
| Standard range (3–7) | One agent per issue | Normal feature work |
| ≥ split threshold (8) | Auto-split into sub-issues | Major refactor → multiple agents |

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I enter the pipeline mid-way?</strong></summary>

Yes. Use explicit step subcommands like `/twisted-work scope` or `/twisted-work execute`. If the objective folder doesn't exist, the skill asks you to name it first.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What happens if a session ends mid-execution?</strong></summary>

All state lives in `state.md` frontmatter. Run `/twisted-work` in a new session — it reads the frontmatter and offers to resume at the exact step and group.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do parallel worktrees work?</strong></summary>

Configurable worktree tiers. Default is 2 tiers: the objective gets a branch off main, each agent gets a branch off the objective. Agents work in parallel, merge back into the objective branch using the configured merge strategy. Optional 3rd tier adds group-level branches for structured history.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is this different from gstack or Nimbalyst?</strong></summary>

gstack provides specialist roles (plan/review/ship). Nimbalyst provides session management and visual kanban. twisted-workflow is the orchestration layer between them — it decomposes objectives into parallel issues, coordinates execution across worktrees, and delegates individual phases to whichever tool you prefer.
